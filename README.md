# Youtube Analysis Tool

The Youtube analysis tool is part of the Associate Data Analyst course offered by NTUC LearningHub. It uses PowerBI as the tool to wrangle and visualise the data.

## Data

The data is from [Kaggle -> YouTube Trending Video Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rsrishav/youtube-trending-video-dataset) by Rishav Sharma.
I used the dataset from US, France, and Japan as part of the data analysis.

## Purpose

The tool was developed with a marketing agency in mind that works with content creator, specifically "YouTubers".  
A client will approach the agency with a product or service that they want marketed. The tool will be used to narrow down the trending videos and the associated content creator.
  
Apart from the narrowing of potential content partners, the tool can also be used to look at certain trends that is happening.
